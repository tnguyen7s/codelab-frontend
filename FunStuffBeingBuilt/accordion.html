                Because she has a desire to become a full-stack engineer when she graduates from college. 
                Since college only offers her backend's knowledge, like backend languages (Java, Python), OS, database, data structure, algorithm, and so on, 
                she wants to grasp more knowledge in the front-end side.
                She also loves to create visual content using CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
                She also loves to learn more about new technology like Angular.
